%default total

||| The sizes, in words, of the per-thread areas, which no fixed bound
||| limits: each is as large as the program's code and the seed's need, so
||| nothing writes past one. `ARGS` holds the arguments of a call beyond the
||| argument registers; `ROOTS` the entries of the largest rooting stub, of
||| which at most one is active at a time, since only the allocation slow
||| paths of generated code collect; `SCRATCH` the slots of the function with
||| the most, and the arguments of the largest closure `idris_apply` stages
||| there.
